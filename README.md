###Simple Messenger on Android

In this assignment, I implemented a simple messenger app on Android. The goal of this app was simple: enabling two Android devices to send messages to each other. The purpose of this assignment was to help myself see if I had the right background for the course. Astonishingly I had the right background and the rest was history, helping me to add few more interesting projects to my repository.
